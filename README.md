# instalock_league_of_legends
## or like I like to call it (instalockoflegends)

### How to use
1. Extract all files into a folder
2. Run League of Legends and login normally
3. Press F2
4. GG, that's it. If you go afk after starting a queue it will automatically accept the game and instalock your hero


### Known issues
If someone declines the queue it won't re-queue you up and you HAVE have to restart this program again.
Will add a feature in the next release to fix this issue, probably.
