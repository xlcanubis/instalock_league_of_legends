# instalock_league_of_legends
## or like I like to call it (instalockoflegends)

### What is this?
If you go afk , after starting a queue it will automatically accept the game and instalock your hero

### Download?
[Click Here](https://github.com/xlcanubis/instalock_league_of_legends/raw/master/instalockoflegends.zip)

### How to use?
1. Extract all files into a folder
2. Run League of Legends and login normally
3. Press F2 on your keyboard, sit back or go afk

#### Important!
League must be the **top** and **active window**, meaning it will not work if you ALT-TAB to another window or if you're browsing on the internet.

Your League of Legends client (not the game, just the client) must run at resolution of `1280*720`



### Known issues
If someone declines the queue it won't re-queue you up and you HAVE have to restart this program again.
Will add a feature in the next release to fix this issue, probably.
